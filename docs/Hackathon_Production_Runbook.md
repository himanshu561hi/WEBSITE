## 2. Environment Configuration & Secrets Management

All production settings are driven by environment variables. A template is maintained in `BACKEND/.env.example`.

### Mandatory Production Variables
| Variable | Description | Security Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP port for backend service (default: `5006`) | Internal or reverse-proxied |
| `NODE_ENV` | Must be set to `production` in live environments | Disables stack traces in HTTP responses |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection URI with TLS and replica set | Must use strong auth credentials |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing Admin and Editorial tokens | Minimum 32 characters, high entropy |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Public origin for CORS allowlisting | Strict domain match (no wildcards) |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Razorpay public key ID | Used for client-side checkout |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`| Razorpay secret key | Strictly server-side; never exposed |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret configured in Razorpay Webhooks | Required for signature validation |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` | Outbound transactional mail server | Must enforce TLS (port 465 or 587) |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP authentication credentials | Zero-trust credentials |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key for email transport | Restrict to sending permissions |
| `CLOUDINARY_*` | Cloudinary storage for PPTs, logos, and assets | Restricted API key and secret |

### Startup Pre-flight Validation
At server startup, `hackathonConfigService.validateStartupConfig()` evaluates configuration variables:
- Asserts presence and minimum entropy of `JWT_SECRET`.
- Validates that `MONGO_URI` connects successfully before serving traffic.
- Validates payment gateway and email configuration.
- **Zero Secrets Rule**: The diagnostic validator masks sensitive strings (e.g., `rzp_live_***`, `re_***`) to prevent credentials from ever leaking into stdout or production log aggregators.

## 3. Database Management, Indexing & Backup/Restore

### Indexing Strategy
To guarantee low latency under peak registration and judging traffic, compound and sparse indexes are deployed:

```javascript
// HackathonAuditLog
{ createdAt: -1 }
{ targetEntity: 1, createdAt: -1 }
{ role: 1, createdAt: -1 }
{ actorId: 1, createdAt: -1 }
{ action: 1, createdAt: -1 }
{ targetId: 1, createdAt: -1 }

// HackathonTeam
{ 'members.email': 1 }
{ hackathonId: 1, status: 1 }
{ hackathonId: 1, paymentStatus: 1 }
{ hackathonId: 1, track: 1 }
{ isDeleted: 1, status: 1 }
{ createdAt: -1 }

// HackathonSubmission
{ hackathonId: 1, status: 1 }
{ hackathonId: 1, isLocked: 1 }
{ createdAt: -1 }

// HackathonCertificate
{ hackathonId: 1, status: 1, isRevoked: 1 }
{ hackathonId: 1, teamId: 1 }
{ createdAt: -1 }

// HackathonPrizeFulfillment
{ hackathonId: 1, status: 1 }
{ createdAt: -1 }
```

### Automated Backup & Restore Procedures
1. **Daily Automated Snapshots**:
   Configure MongoDB Atlas Continuous Cloud Backups with point-in-time recovery (PITR) enabled and 7-day retention.
2. **Pre-Milestone CLI Dump (e.g. before Result Publication)**:
   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="<MONGO_URI>" --gzip --archive="./backups/hackathon-pre-results-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).gz"
   ```
3. **Database Restore**:
   ```bash
   mongorestore --uri="<MONGO_URI>" --gzip --archive="./backups/<backup-file-name>.gz" --drop
   ```

---

## 4. Lifecycle Operational Procedures (Phases 1–9)

### Phase 1–2: Unstop Import & Pre-flight Validation
1. Export participant registration CSV from Unstop portal.
2. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Overview -> Import Unstop CSV**.
3. Upload CSV file. The parser validates mandatory columns: `Team Name`, `Team Leader Email`, `Member Details`.
4. Review dry-run summary: Total records, new teams created, duplicate leader emails skipped.
5. Confirm import. All teams initialize in `IMPORTED` status with `paymentStatus: "PENDING"`.

### Phase 3: Screening & Shortlisting
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Teams**.
2. Filter by track or status `IMPORTED` / `UNDER_REVIEW`.
3. Open team drawer to review idea description and PPT deck.
4. Score initial criteria (Innovation, Idea Quality, Feasibility, Presentation).
5. Click **Shortlist Team**. System transitions status to `SHORTLISTED`, logs immutable audit record, and triggers transactional invitation email containing payment link.

### Phase 4: ₹49 Payment Gateway & Webhook Handling
1. Shortlisted teams login to participant portal to verify roster and proceed to payment.
2. Checkout initiates Razorpay standard modal for ₹49.
3. Upon payment success, Razorpay posts `payment.captured` or `order.paid` event to `/api/hackathon/payment/webhook`.
4. Backend verifies webhook signature using HMAC-SHA256 (`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
5. Upon valid signature:
   - Team `paymentStatus` transitions to `PAID`.
   - Team `status` transitions to `CONFIRMED`.
   - WhatsApp invite link and confirmation email are automatically transmitted.

### Phase 5: Submission Window & Server Deadline Enforcement
1. Submission window opens automatically based on `submissionDeadline` in Hackathon Settings.
2. Teams input GitHub URL, live deployment URL, video demo link, and project description.
3. Participants click **Final Submit & Lock**. System locks submission (`isLocked: true`, `submittedAt: Date.now()`).
4. **Server Clock Deadline Enforcement**: Once `Date.now() > submissionDeadline`, backend automatically rejects edits, regardless of client time manipulation.
5. In exceptional cases (e.g. participant technical glitch), Admin can unlock submission with an audited reason via `POST /api/hackathon/admin/submissions/:id/unlock`.

### Phase 6: Editorial Judge Provisioning & Blind Judging
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Editorial & Judges**.
2. Invite judges via email and assign domain expertise tracks.
3. Perform **Automated Assignment**: System distributes locked submissions evenly across judges, ensuring no judge evaluates more teams than max load and avoiding conflicts of interest.
4. Judges login via `/hackathon/editorial/login` with their unique credentials.
5. Blind review mode hides team school/personal details, displaying only Project Title, Track, Code Repository, and Demo URL.
6. Judges submit rubric scores (0-10) across:
   - Innovation & Originality
   - Technical Execution
   - Design & Usability
   - Impact & Feasibility
7. Completed evaluations update the real-time evaluation tally.

### Phase 7: Score Aggregation, Tiebreak & Official Result Lockdown
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Results**.
2. Click **Compute Aggregated Results**. Backend averages multi-judge evaluations and sorts descending.
3. Review tiebreakers: If two teams tie, system applies rubric tiebreak priority (Technical Execution -> Innovation -> Usability) or Admin resolves manually.
4. Assign Winner Tiers (Winner, 1st Runner Up, 2nd Runner Up, Best Track Innovation).
5. Click **Publish Results** to allow participants to see outcomes.
6. Click **Lock Official Results**. This marks results `isLocked: true`. Once locked, no judge or admin can alter rankings, scores, or winner awards without an emergency audit unlock.

### Phase 8: Automated Certificate Issuance & Prize Pipeline
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Certificates**.
2. Click **Generate Certificates**. System creates verified records for:
   - Participation: All confirmed team members who submitted a project.
   - Winners: Winning teams with their official award title.
3. Each certificate generates a cryptographically random verification code (e.g., `CAN-2026-X8B9K2`) and unique certificate number.
4. Public verification URL `/hackathon/verify/:code` allows recruiters and universities to authenticate credentials in real time.
5. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Prizes & Fulfillment** to track claim forms, disbursement payment modes (UPI/Bank Transfer), and dispatch tracking numbers.

### Phase 9: Real-time Operations & Health Center
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Operations & Health**.
2. Review **Health Index (0-100)** and real-time status banner.
3. Monitor the **9-Point System Completion Checklist**.
4. Review **Actionable Alerts**: Click "Resolve" to immediately navigate to the relevant workflow tab.
5. Execute **Operational Quick Search** (`Ctrl/Cmd + K` or Search button) to locate any entity across the platform in under 50ms.
6. Trigger **Controlled CSV Data Export** for offline archival.

## 5. Monitoring, Telemetry & Health Alerts

The Operations Service (`hackathonOpsService.js`) aggregates operational telemetry continuously:

### Health Score Weighting
- Base Score: `100` points
- Deductions:
  - Missing Webhook Secret: `-25` points (Critical payment risk)
  - Unlocked Published Results: `-15` points (Integrity risk)
  - Overdue Pending Evaluations: `-10` points (Judging bottleneck)
  - Email Bounce Rate > 5%: `-10` points (Deliverability risk)
  - Unclaimed Winner Prizes: `-5` points (Fulfillment delay)

### Email Deliverability Monitoring
Telemetry tracks all outbound transactional mail dispatched via Resend/SMTP:
- Delivery rate target: `>= 98.0%`
- Bounce rate alert threshold: `> 3.0%`
- Spam complaint threshold: `> 0.1%`
- Automatically logs all transmission outcomes to `EmailLog` collection.

---

## 6. Data Governance, Export Sanitization & Compliance

### CSV Formula Injection Defense
When exporting datasets for spreadsheet viewing (Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets), values beginning with characters `=, +, -, @` can trigger formula execution.
- `hackathonOpsService.exportResourceAsCsv` sanitizes all text cells:
  ```javascript
  if (/^[=+\-@]/.test(cellString)) {
    cellString = "'" + cellString; // Prepend single quote to neutralize formula
  }
  ```

### Strict Resource Allowlisting
Exports are strictly restricted to allowlisted resources:
`teams`, `submissions`, `editorial-assignments`, `editorial-evaluations`, `results`, `certificates`, `prizes`, `sponsors`.
Arbitrary collection queries are rejected with HTTP 400.

### PII & Secret Stripping
All exports omit passwords, password hashes, webhook secrets, authentication tokens, and private API keys.

## 7. Incident Response Playbooks

### Playbook 1: Razorpay Webhook Outage or Signature Mismatch
**Symptoms**: Team paid ₹49 on Razorpay, but status remains `PENDING` on dashboard.
1. Check `BACKEND` logs for `Invalid Razorpay webhook signature`.
2. Verify `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the secret configured in Razorpay Dashboard.
3. In Razorpay Dashboard -> Webhooks:
   - Ensure the configured Webhook URL exactly matches: `https://<api-domain>/api/hackathon/payment/webhook` (Note: singular `payment`, not `payments`).
   - Confirm active events: `order.paid`, `payment.captured`.
   - View the failed event and check the HTTP response code.
4. **Manual Remediation**:
   - Locate payment in Razorpay Dashboard and obtain `payment_id` and `order_id`.
   - In Admin Workspace -> Teams, open team drawer.
   - Click **Verify Payment Manually**, enter payment ID, and confirm. System updates team to `PAID` / `CONFIRMED` and logs an audit trail.

### Playbook 2: Accidental Premature Result Publication
**Symptoms**: Results published before judging was complete or tiebreaks were resolved.
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Results**.
2. If results are not locked, toggle **Publish Results** to `OFF`.
3. If results are locked:
   - Run audited emergency unlock via Admin console.
   - Set `isResultsPublished = false` in `HackathonSettings`.
   - Audit log will record the retraction event with admin username and timestamp.

### Playbook 3: Judge Account Lockout or Compromised Password
**Symptoms**: Judge forgot password or entered incorrect credentials > 5 times.
1. Navigate to **Admin Workspace -> Editorial & Judges**.
2. Locate the judge in the table.
3. Click **Reset Password / Re-send Invitation**.
4. System invalidates existing tokens, generates a temporary high-entropy access credential, and logs an audit event.

### Playbook 4: Sudden Spike in Email Bounces
**Symptoms**: Deliverability widget shows bounce rate > 5%.
1. Check **Admin Workspace -> Operations & Health -> Email Deliverability Monitor**.
2. Inspect `EmailLog` entries for SMTP error codes (e.g. `550 User Unknown`, `421 Rate Limit`).
3. If domain throttling is reported, switch primary transport to Resend API fallback.
4. Export failed recipient list via controlled CSV export and verify email syntax.

## 8. Security Hardening & Pre-Flight Checklist

Before opening the platform for live traffic, verify each checkpoint:

- [x] **Rate Limiting Active**:
  - `hackathonPublicLimiter`: 120 req / 15 min on public endpoints.
  - `hackathonAuthLimiter`: 25 req / 15 min on login/register.
  - `hackathonExportLimiter`: 35 req / 15 min on CSV data exports.
- [x] **Zero Secrets in Git**: Verified `.env` is gitignored; only `.env.example` committed.
- [x] **MongoDB Indexes Built**: All compound and query indexes active on MongoDB cluster.
- [x] **Razorpay Webhook Verified**: Webhook endpoint tested with live HMAC signature.
- [x] **CORS Allowlist Restricted**: CORS configuration matches production frontend origin.
- [x] **Audit Logging Active**: All state modifications generate immutable `HackathonAuditLog` records.
- [x] **Blind Judging Enabled**: Judge views strip participant personal and institutional identifiers.
- [x] **Server-Time Deadlines Enforced**: System clock strictly governs submission lockdown.
- [x] **Certificate Verification Operational**: Public verification endpoint tested with valid and invalid codes.
- [x] **Automated Test Suites Passing**: 100% passing across all phase regression suites.

## 9. Phase M11 Platform Hardening & Operational Observability

### 9.1 Pre-Deployment Automated Validation Tools
Before any staging or production deployment, administrators should execute the automated M11 verification utilities:

1. **Validate Environment Configuration (Zero Secret Output):**
   ```bash
   node BACKEND/scripts/validateProductionConfig.js
   ```
   Ensures `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, Razorpay, and SMTP/Resend variables are properly configured.

2. **Read-Only Database Referential Integrity Audit:**
   ```bash
   node BACKEND/scripts/auditMultiHackathonIntegrity.js
   ```
   Scans for orphan payments, dangling assignments, duplicate canonical team IDs, and cross-hackathon reference mismatches without altering database records.

### 9.2 Request Correlation & Tracing
All HTTP requests are tagged with an `X-Request-ID` header. In server-side error logs, `[GlobalError] [requestId]` enables instant correlation of user reports with backend diagnostics.

### 9.3 Multi-Hackathon Isolation Verification
- Every operational query must be qualified with `req.hackathonId`.
- Operational endpoints (`/admin/search`, `/admin/team-360`, `/admin/export`) require explicit hackathon context and never default to legacy 2026 data.
- Only one hackathon can have `status: 'ACTIVE'` at any time; concurrent activations are strictly rejected.
